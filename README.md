# Automator-Image-Resizer
Automator workflow for batch resizing images. With one click, it copies the folder to the desktop, renames, converts any non jpeg images to jpegs, and resizes them to 3000px on the longest side, usually giving files around 1mb.


 # Installation
Clone this repo 'git clone github.com/echorec/Automator-Image-Resizer'
Open 'Image Resize.workflow' with automator

# How-to-Use
Once cloned or downloaded, double click to install. By default the resized images save to desktop in a folder called "YOURFOLDER_resized" and images will rename as "YOURIMAGE_resized". If you want to change anything, open the workflow in Automator. Once installed, just right click any folder of images and hit "Image Resize" from services towards the bottom of the list. Easy.
